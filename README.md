### FastTrack to React Component Development Training

The **FastTrack to React Component Development Training** class teaches the essentials of building UI components with React. 

The course dives deep into the core workings of React, and explores the practical aspects of developing React projects. 

Utilizing best practices, students build a real application utilizing the more important aspects of React.

* Core Audience: Experienced JavaScript developers interested in bringing structure to their rapidly growing web applications

* Prerequisites: Advanced JavaScript that includes Object Oriented concepts, Ajax, promises, prototypal inheritance, ES6 and module design patterns. 

  Ideally attendees of *JavaScript (ES2017) for React and GraphQL Developers Course* with 3-6 months of recent Javascript experience.

### Lab Setup

#### Ensure that you have `node` and `npm` installed
In a terminal, powershell, or cmd prompt:

```
node -v
```
Should be >= 8.0
```
npm -v
``` 
Should be greater than 5.2.

#### If needed, install `Node.js LTS` from <a target="_setup" href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>

If you need multiple versions of Node installed, you may want to install <a target="_ref" href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">Node Version Manager for Mac or Linux</a> or <a target="_ref" href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows">NVM for Windows</a>

Add node to your path, then **launch a new** terminal, cmd prompt, or powershell:

```
node -v
```
Should be >= 8.0
```
npm -v
``` 
Should be greater than 5.2.

Install eslint
```
npm install -g eslint
```
If npm -g doesn't work, you may have permissions issues. A workaround is `npx` which will get from npm if needed and install in local directory.
```
npx install -g eslint
```

We'll do more setup in class as needed.
