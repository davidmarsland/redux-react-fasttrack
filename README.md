### FastTrack to Redux with React Training
**FastTrack to Redux with React Training** â€‹teaches students how to use two important React-related libraries: Redux and React Router. Building upon the solid foundation of Flux principles, Redux is explained and demonstrated as it related to Flux and React. Additionally, routing with React Router is explored and integrated with Redux. Utilizing best practices, students build a real application from scratch utilizing the more import aspects of React, Redux and React Router.

* Prerequisites: Advanced JavaScript ES6 and React Development Experience

  Ideally attendees of **FastTrack to React Training** with 3-6 months of recent Javascript experience.

* If you want to learn more about ES6, aka ES2015, here are some good tutorials:
      <br><a target="_babel" href="https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/">https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/</a>
      <br><a target="_udacity" href="https://www.udacity.com/course/es6-javascript-improved--ud356

### Lab Setup

#### Ensure that you have `node` and `npm` installed
In a terminal, powershell, or cmd prompt:

```
node -v
```
Should be >= 8.0
```
npm -v
``` 
Should be greater than 5.2.

#### If needed, install `Node.js LTS` from <a target="_setup" href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>

If you need multiple versions of Node installed, you may want to install <a target="_ref" href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">Node Version Manager for Mac or Linux</a> or <a target="_ref" href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows">NVM for Windows</a>

Add node to your path, then **launch a new** terminal, cmd prompt, or powershell:

```
node -v
```
Should be >= 8.0
```
npm -v
``` 
Should be greater than 5.2.

Install eslint
```
npm install -g eslint
```
If npm -g doesn't work, you may have permissions issues. A workaround is `npx` which will get from npm if needed and install in local directory.
```
npx install -g eslint
```
  <a target="_ref" href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions">Fixing NPM Permissions on Mac or Linux</a>

We'll do more setup in class as needed.

### Redux DevTools

<a target="_ref" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en">Redux DevTools - Chrome Web Store</a>

Note, you must add a line to source code to enable tooling.  Try this on a Redux example without this and it will provide instructions:
<br>*No store found. Make sure to follow the <a target="_ref" href="https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension#usage">instructions</a>.*

For a basic Redux store simply add:            
```JavaScript
 const store = createStore(
   reducer, /* preloadedState, */
+  window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ && window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__()
 );
```

### Redux Todo Example App from Redux Course 
* <a target="_redux" href="https://github.com/sadams/todo-redux-react-webpack">https://github.com/sadams/todo-redux-react-webpack</a>
* Clone repo, then:
```

```
git clone -b 00 https://github.com/gothinkster/react-redux-realworld-example-app.git
```
Then `cd react-redux-realworld-example-app` and <br> `npm install` to download node modules (may take a while on windows) and `npm run start` to run a development server
```
cd react-redux-realworld-example-app
npm install
